# Ansible role - Promtail

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/grafana/grafana-ansible-collection)](LICENSE)

The Ansible Promtail Role allows you to effortlessly deploy and manage Promtail, agent which ships contents of local logs to private Loki.
This role is tailored for operating systems such as **RedHat**, **Rocky Linux**, **AlmaLinux**, **Ubuntu**, and **Debian**.

**üîë Key Features**
- **‚ö° Root-less/Root runtime**: By default, Promtail operates in root-less mode, utilizing ACL (Access Control List) to securely access logs without requiring root permissions. You have the option to configure root mode if necessary.
- **üßπ Effortless Uninstall**: Easily remove Promtail from your system setting the "promtail_uninstall" variable.

üì¢ **[Check the blog post](https://voidquark.com/blog/rootless-promtail-with-ansible/)** üìù **Learn more about root-less mode.**

## Role Variables

```yaml
promtail_version: "latest"
```
The version of Promtail to download and deploy. Supported standard version "3.0.0" format or "latest".

```yaml
promtail_uninstall: "false"
```

If set to `true` will perfom uninstall instead of deployment.

```yaml
promtail_http_listen_port: 9080
```
The TCP port on which Promtail listens. By default, it listens on port `9080`.

```yaml
promtail_http_listen_address: "0.0.0.0"
```
The address on which Promtail listens for HTTP requests. By default, it listens on all interfaces.

```yaml
promtail_expose_port: false
```
By default, this is set to `false`. It supports only simple `firewalld` configurations. If set to `true`, a firewalld rule is added to expose the TCP `promtail_http_listen_port`. If set to `false`, configuration is skipped. If the `firewalld.service` is not active, all firewalld tasks are skipped.

```yaml
promtail_positions_path: "/var/lib/promtail"
```
Promtail path for position file. File indicating how far it has read into a file. It is needed for when Promtail is restarted to allow it to continue from where it left off.

```yaml
promtail_runtime_mode: "acl"
```
By default, Promtail runs in root-less mode. It supports two modes:
- `acl`: Root-less mode, utilizing ACL permission model to read target log files.
- `root`: Root mode, where Promtail runs as root and ACL configuration is skipped.

```yaml
promtail_extra_flags: []
```
Additional flags to be passed to the Promtail systemd unit.

```yaml
promtail_user_append_groups:
  - "systemd-journal"
```
Appends the promtail user to specific groups in root-less mode. By default, it appends the user to the `systemd-journal` group, granting permission to read system journal logs.

```yaml
promtail_download_url_rpm: "https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v{{ promtail_version }}/promtail-{{ promtail_version }}.{{ __promtail_arch }}.rpm"
```
The default download URL for the Promtail rpm package from GitHub.

```yaml
promtail_download_url_deb: "https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v{{ promtail_version }}/promtail_{{ promtail_version }}_{{ __promtail_arch }}.deb"
```
The default download URL for the Promtail deb package from GitHub.

```yaml
promtail_server:
  http_listen_port: "{{ promtail_http_listen_port }}"
  http_listen_address: "{{ promtail_http_listen_address }}"
```
The `server` block configures Promtail behavior as an HTTP server. [All possible values for `server`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#server)

```yaml
promtail_positions:
  filename: "{{ promtail_positions_path }}/positions.yaml"
```
The `positions` block configures where Promtail will save a file indicating how far it has read into a file. It is needed for when Promtail is restarted to allow it to continue from where it left off. [All possible values for `positions`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#positions)

```yaml
promtail_clients:
  - url: http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push
```
The `clients` block configures how Promtail connects to instances of Loki. [All possible values for `clients`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#clients). ‚ö†Ô∏è This configuration is mandatory. By default, it's empty, and the example above serves as a simple illustration for inspiration.

promtail_scrape_configs:
  - job_name: system
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - localhost
        labels:
          job: messages

      - targets:
          - localhost
        labels:
          job: nginx
          instance: "{{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}"
          __path__: /var/log/nginx/*.log
```
The `scrape_configs` block configures how Promtail can scrape logs from a series of targets using a specified discovery method. [All possible values for `scrape_configs`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#scrape_configs). ‚ö†Ô∏è This configuration is mandatory.
